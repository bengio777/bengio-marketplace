# Tech News Briefing Formatting

Transform curated, routed stories into a tabbed markdown briefing document.

## Output Structure

Use the template at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/daily.md` as the structural guide. The final document has these parts:

1. **Header** — date, day of week, cadence badge, story count, generation timestamp
2. **Tab: AI News** — tiered stories (Must-Read / Worth Knowing / On the Radar)
3. **Tab: AI Breakthroughs & Viral** — flat list of high-signal stories
4. **Tab: Cyber Intel** — sectioned security stories
5. **Footer** — sources checked, generation note

## Tab Markers

Each tab is preceded by an HTML comment marker on its own line. This is how the dashboard parser detects tabs:

```markdown
<!-- tab: AI News -->
```

Tab marker names must match exactly:
- `AI News`
- `AI Breakthroughs & Viral`
- `Cyber Intel`

## Per-Item Format

Each story item follows this exact format:

```markdown
- **[Story Title](url)** — 1-2 sentence summary. *Source: SourceName*
```

Rules:
- Title is a clickable markdown link to the source article
- Summary is concise: 1-2 sentences max, active voice
- Source name appears italicized at the end
- No emoji anywhere in the document
- No numbering — use unordered bullet lists

## Tab 1: AI News

Uses H2 headings for tiers with horizontal rule separators:

```markdown
<!-- tab: AI News -->

## Must-Read

- **[Story Title](url)** — Summary. *Source: SourceName*

---

## Worth Knowing

- **[Story Title](url)** — Summary. *Source: SourceName*

---

## On the Radar

- **[Story Title](url)** — Summary. *Source: SourceName*
```

If a tier has zero stories, omit that section entirely. Do not include an empty heading.

## Tab 2: AI Breakthroughs & Viral

No tier headings — just a flat list under a single H2:

```markdown
<!-- tab: AI Breakthroughs & Viral -->

## Breakthroughs

- **[Story Title](url)** — Summary. *Source: SourceName*
```

If zero stories qualify for this tab, omit the entire tab (including the `<!-- tab: -->` marker).

## Tab 3: Cyber Intel

Uses H2 headings for sections:

```markdown
<!-- tab: Cyber Intel -->

## AI x Cyber

- **[Story Title](url)** — Summary. *Source: SourceName*

## Breaches & Incidents

- **[Story Title](url)** — Summary. *Source: SourceName*

## Active Threats

- **[Story Title](url)** — Summary. *Source: SourceName*

## OSINT Signal

- **[Story Title](url)** — Summary. *Source: SourceName*
```

Omit any section with zero stories. If the entire Cyber Intel tab has zero stories, omit the tab.

## Summary Writing Rules

- **Active voice**: "Anthropic launched..." not "A new feature was launched by..."
- **Specific**: Include concrete details (version numbers, dollar amounts, CVE IDs, CVSS scores)
- **No hedging**: "Anthropic announced X" not "It appears that Anthropic may have announced X"
- **No opinion**: Report what happened, not what you think about it
- **Technical audience**: Assume the reader is a tech-literate professional. No need to explain what an LLM or CVE is.
- **Cyber stories**: Include CVE IDs when available. Mention CVSS score if >= 8.0. Note if CISA KEV listed.

## Header Format

```markdown
# BPG Tech News Briefing — [Full Date]

**[Day of Week]** | Daily | [N] stories | Generated [HH:MM AM/PM MST]
```

Example:
```markdown
# BPG Tech News Briefing — February 22, 2026

**Saturday** | Daily | 18 stories | Generated 6:00 AM MST
```

## Footer Format

```markdown
---

*Sources checked: Anthropic Blog, OpenAI Blog, Hacker News, Ars Technica, The Verge, TechCrunch, Ben's Bites, Twitter/X, Microsoft AI, Meta AI, arXiv, Product Hunt, GitHub Trending, Reddit, Dev.to, BleepingComputer, Dark Reading, SecurityWeek, Krebs on Security, The Record, r/netsec*
*Generated by BPG Tech News Agent*
```

If any sources were unreachable during research, add a note:
```markdown
*Note: The following sources were unreachable during this run: [source list]*
```

## Empty Briefing

At minimum, the briefing should have at least one tab with stories. If curation produced zero stories across all tabs, output:
```markdown
*No significant tech news stories found for today.*
```

## Final Check

Before saving, verify:
- [ ] Every story links to the **specific article page** — no homepage or section-page URLs (e.g., `https://thehackernews.com/` is a homepage and must never appear as a story link)
- [ ] No duplicate stories appear across tabs
- [ ] Summaries are 1-2 sentences (no longer)
- [ ] No emoji in the document
- [ ] Tab markers are present and correctly named
- [ ] Empty tabs/sections are omitted entirely
- [ ] CVE IDs included in cyber stories where available

If any story still has a homepage URL after formatting, **remove that story** from the briefing.
