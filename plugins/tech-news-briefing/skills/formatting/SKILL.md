# Tech News Briefing Formatting

Transform curated, tiered stories into a clean markdown briefing document.

## Output Structure

Use the template at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/briefing.md` as the structural guide. The final document has these sections in order:

1. **Header** — date, day of week, story count, generation timestamp
2. **Must-Read** — highest-priority stories (may be empty on quiet days)
3. **Worth Knowing** — important stories worth attention
4. **On the Radar** — emerging stories to watch
5. **Footer** — sources checked, generation note

## Per-Item Format

Each story item follows this exact format:

```markdown
- **[Story Title](url)** — 1-2 sentence summary. *Source: SourceName*
```

Rules:
- Title is a clickable markdown link to the source article
- Summary is concise: 1-2 sentences max, active voice
- Source name appears italicized at the end
- No emoji anywhere in the document
- No numbering — use unordered bullet lists

## Section Headers

Each tier section uses an H2 heading with a horizontal rule separator:

```markdown
---

## Must-Read

- **[Story Title](url)** — Summary. *Source: SourceName*

---

## Worth Knowing

- **[Story Title](url)** — Summary. *Source: SourceName*
```

## Empty Sections

- If a tier has zero stories, omit that section entirely. Do not include an empty heading.
- At minimum, the briefing should have at least one section with stories. If curation produced zero stories across all tiers, note: `*No significant tech news stories found for today.*`

## Summary Writing Rules

- **Active voice**: "Anthropic launched..." not "A new feature was launched by..."
- **Specific**: Include concrete details (version numbers, dollar amounts, feature names)
- **No hedging**: "Anthropic announced X" not "It appears that Anthropic may have announced X"
- **No opinion**: Report what happened, not what you think about it
- **Technical audience**: Assume the reader is a tech-literate professional. No need to explain what an LLM is.

## Header Format

```markdown
# Tech News Briefing — [Full Date]
**[Day of Week]** | [N] stories | Generated [HH:MM AM/PM MST]
```

Example:
```markdown
# Tech News Briefing — February 21, 2026
**Saturday** | 14 stories | Generated 6:00 AM MST
```

## Footer Format

```markdown
---

*Sources checked: Anthropic Blog, OpenAI Blog, Hacker News, Ars Technica, The Verge, TechCrunch, Ben's Bites, Twitter/X, Microsoft AI, Meta AI, Dev.to, Product Hunt*
*Generated by BPG Tech News Agent*
```

If any sources were unreachable during research, add a note:
```markdown
*Note: The following sources were unreachable during this run: [source list]*
```
